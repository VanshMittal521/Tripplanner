# Tripplanner AI — A Multi-Agent Travel Planner with LangGraph

An open-source AI travel planner that turns a natural-language trip request into a practical travel plan with flight suggestions, hotel ideas, and a day-by-day itinerary. The project uses a multi-agent workflow built with LangGraph, LangChain, and FastAPI.

## Why this project?

Planning a trip usually means jumping between multiple websites, tools, and spreadsheets. This project brings that flow into one experience by combining:

- a flight-search agent,
- a hotel-research agent,
- an itinerary-planning agent, and
- a final response agent,

all coordinated through a LangGraph workflow.
